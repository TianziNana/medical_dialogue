# Fairness-Aware Medical Text Summarization with Counterfactual Data Augmentation

## Abstract

This project develops a fairness-aware medical text summarization system that addresses demographic bias in clinical AI. Using the AGBonnet augmented clinical notes dataset, we fine-tune Flan-T5-base with LoRA adaptation and implement counterfactual data augmentation to reduce performance disparities across demographic groups. Our approach demonstrates that fairness interventions can be achieved with minimal performance trade-offs: while overall ROUGE-L decreases by only 0.89%, we achieve a significant 6.84% improvement in age-based counterfactual fairness. This work provides a practical framework for developing equitable medical NLP systems that maintain clinical utility while reducing demographic bias.

## Introduction & Background

Clinical text summarization represents a critical application of medical natural language processing, with the potential to reduce documentation burden and improve healthcare delivery. However, existing medical AI systems often exhibit performance disparities across patient demographics, potentially exacerbating healthcare inequities. This is particularly concerning in clinical settings where biased model outputs could influence treatment decisions and patient outcomes.

Recent advances in large language models have enabled sophisticated medical text processing, yet most approaches optimize solely for accuracy metrics without considering fairness across patient subgroups. This oversight is problematic in healthcare contexts where systematic bias against certain demographics—women, pediatric patients, or elderly populations—can perpetuate existing disparities in medical care.

### Problem Statement

This work addresses two fundamental research questions:

1. **Fairness Quantification**: How can we systematically measure and characterize demographic bias in medical text summarization across gender and age groups?

2. **Fairness Mitigation**: Can counterfactual data augmentation techniques improve demographic fairness in medical summarization without compromising clinical accuracy?

### Research Contributions

- **Comprehensive fairness evaluation framework** including group-wise performance analysis and counterfactual stability testing
- **Novel counterfactual data augmentation approach** using syntactic analysis for targeted demographic bias reduction  
- **Empirical demonstration** of fairness-performance trade-offs in medical summarization
- **Open-source implementation** enabling reproducible fairness-aware medical NLP research

## Dataset

### Source and Characteristics
- **Dataset**: AGBonnet/augmented-clinical-notes
- **Scale**: 30,000 clinical conversations with structured summaries
- **Content**: Doctor-patient dialogues paired with medical summaries containing visit motivation, patient summary, and admission information
- **Domain**: General clinical encounters across multiple medical specialties

### Demographic Processing
We implement rule-based demographic classification using linguistic pattern matching:

**Gender Classification**: 
- Pattern-based extraction using pronouns (he/she/him/her/his/hers) and explicit gender terms
- Binary classification: male/female (unknown cases excluded)

**Age Group Classification**:
- Age extraction from explicit mentions (e.g., "25-year-old", "pediatric patient")
- Three categories: Pediatric (<18 years), Adult (18-65 years), Elderly (>65 years)

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Quality Filtering**: Remove samples with insufficient text length (<100 characters)
2. **Balanced Sampling**: 1,505 samples per demographic group to ensure equal representation
3. **Stratified Splitting**: 70%/15%/15% train/validation/test split maintaining demographic balance
4. **Text Standardization**: JSON parsing and format normalization for summary fields

Final dataset composition: 9,030 samples across 6 demographic groups with balanced representation.

## Methodology

### Baseline Architecture
- **Model**: Flan-T5-base (247M parameters)
- **Adaptation**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning
  - Rank (r): 12
  - Alpha: 32
  - Dropout: 0.1
  - Target modules: attention and feed-forward layers
- **Training Configuration**: 4 epochs, batch size 6, learning rate 8e-4

### Counterfactual Data Augmentation

#### Syntactic Analysis Framework
We employ spaCy-based dependency parsing to identify demographic tokens and generate high-quality counterfactuals:

1. **Token Identification**: Extract demographic-relevant terms through syntactic role analysis
2. **Contextual Replacement**: Swap gender/age terms while preserving grammatical structure
3. **Intelligent Insertion**: Add demographic descriptors where implicit references exist

#### Targeted Augmentation Strategy
Based on baseline performance analysis, we implement differential augmentation:

- **Underperforming Groups** (ROUGE-L < 0.55):
  - Male adult: +250 samples (15.8% augmentation rate)
  - Male pediatric: +250 samples (14.7% augmentation rate)
  - Female pediatric: +250 samples (14.8% augmentation rate)

- **Well-performing Groups**:
  - All other groups: +50 samples (2.6-3.3% augmentation rate)

#### Quality Assurance
- Deduplication to prevent overfitting
- Semantic preservation validation
- Manual inspection of generated counterfactuals

### Fairness-Aware Training Enhancements
- **Group-adaptive sample weighting** based on inverse performance scaling
- **Counterfactual sample boosting** with 1.3× weight multiplier
- **Data-level fairness** through demographic balance and targeted augmentation

### Evaluation Framework

#### Performance Metrics
- **ROUGE Scores**: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L for content overlap assessment
- **Entity Coverage**: Medical entity extraction and coverage analysis
- **Text Quality**: Length analysis and summary coherence evaluation

#### Fairness Metrics
- **Group-wise Performance Gaps**: Maximum difference in ROUGE-L across demographic groups
- **Standard Deviation Analysis**: Performance variance across groups
- **Fairness Gap Reduction**: Percentage improvement in cross-group disparities

#### Counterfactual Fairness Evaluation
- **Gender Swaps**: he↔she, him↔her, male↔female transformations
- **Age Swaps**: child↔adult↔elderly, pediatric↔geriatric substitutions  
- **Stability Measurement**: ROUGE-L similarity between original and counterfactual predictions
- **Robustness Analysis**: Percentage of predictions with >90% similarity after demographic swaps
